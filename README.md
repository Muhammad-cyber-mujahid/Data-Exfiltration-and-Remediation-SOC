# Data-Exfiltration-and-Remediation-SOC
This project simulates a real-world scenario where an attacker exploits a misconfigured FTP server to exfiltrate sensitive data. It walks through the attack process using Kali Linux and Nmap, and then demonstrates how a SOC analyst can detect and respond using practical remediation steps on Windows 10.
